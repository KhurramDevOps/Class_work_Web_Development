        The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of
        rendering box) of an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, the display property is used to specify the type of rendering
        box used for an HTML element.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many values for the display property. Some of the most
        commonly used values are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>block</li>
        <li>inline</li>
        <li>inline-block</li>
        <li>none</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Block-level elements</h3>
      <p>
        A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full
        width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>div</code> element is a block-level element. By default, a
        block-level element has a line break before and after it and does not
        allow other elements to sit next to it.
      </p>
      <h3>Inline elements</h3>
      <p>
        An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much
        width as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is in contrast to a block-level element, which always starts on a
        new line and takes up the full width available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>span</code> element is an inline element. An inline element
        can wrap some text inside a paragraph without disrupting the flow of
        that paragraph.
      </p>
      <h3>Inline-block elements</h3>
      <p>
        An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line
        as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>img</code> element is an inline-block element. An inline-block
        element is often used to center content horizontally within its
        container.
      </p>
      <h3>None</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>none</code> value hides an element. The element will be
        hidden, and
      </p>
