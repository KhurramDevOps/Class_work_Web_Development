        As the country continues sliding in corruption perceptions, democratic standards, and political and civil
        liberties, as evidenced by the recent deterioration in its ranking in various global indices that track these
        social indicators, Mr Tarar on Wednesday told attendees at a high-level segment of the 58th Session of the UN
        Human Rights Council that Pakistan remains “strongly committed” to upholding “all human rights”.

        Surprisingly, he held up the 26th Amendment as an example of the “robust legislative and policy measures” taken
        towards protecting human rights in the country. Ever since it was enacted, the 26th Amendment has come to be
        known for many things. Upholding the Pakistani people’s rights is not one of them. Indeed, the consensus among
        most fair-minded folk seems to be that it has done quite the opposite.

        Ironically, on the same day that Mr Tarar was painting his rosy picture for the UN, Freedom House, a
        Washington-based think tank that tracks democracy and threats to freedom around the world, declared that
        Pakistan remained a ‘partly free’ country but also lopped off three points from its already dismal ranking on
        the index.

        “[…] Key factors driving the degradation in rights and liberties included violence and the repression of
        political opponents during elections, ongoing armed conflicts, and the spread of authoritarian practices”, it
        noted in a general comment on its ranking of various countries.
