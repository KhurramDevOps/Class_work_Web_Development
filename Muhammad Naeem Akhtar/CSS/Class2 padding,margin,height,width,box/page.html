            Moreover, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in their homes —
            usually at night while their whole families were present — rather than during the course of military
            activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they regarded as an intelligence standpoint,
            it was easier to locate the individuals in their private houses. Additional automated systems, including one
            called “Where’s Daddy?” also revealed here for the first time, were used specifically to track the targeted
            individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family’s residences.

    <div id="test"> In 2021, a book titled “The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and
        Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World” was released in English under the pen name “Brigadier
        General Y.S.” In it, the author — a man who we confirmed to be the current commander of the elite Israeli
        intelligence unit 8200 — makes the case for designing a special machine that could rapidly process massive
        amounts of data to generate thousands of potential “targets” for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such
        technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a “human bottleneck for both locating the new targets
        and decision-making to approve the targets.”

        <div class="test1">The Lavender machine joins another AI system, “The Gospel,” about which information was
            revealed in a previous investigation by +972 and Local Call in November 2023, as well as in the Israeli
            military’s own publications. A fundamental difference between the two systems is in the definition of the
            target: whereas The Gospel marks buildings and structures that the army claims militants operate from,
            Lavender marks people — and puts them on a kill list. </div>

        <div class="test2"> In addition, according to the sources, when it came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by
            Lavender, the army preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as “dumb” bombs (in contrast to
            “smart” precision bombs), which can destroy entire buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant
            casualties. “You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people — it’s very expensive for the
            country and there’s a shortage [of those bombs],” said C., one of the intelligence officers. Another source
            said that they had personally authorized the bombing of “hundreds” of private homes of alleged junior
            operatives marked by Lavender, with many of these attacks killing civilians and entire families as
            “collateral damage.”
            In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also decided during the first weeks of
            the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or
            20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of
            low-ranking militants. The sources added that, in the event that the target was a senior Hamas official with
            the rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more
            than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander.
