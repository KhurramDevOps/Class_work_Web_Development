        <u>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used to style and layout web pages. It allows
            developers to control the appearance of elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. By
            using CSS, websites can achieve responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. There
            are three main ways to apply CSS: inline, internal, and external stylesheets, with external stylesheets
            being the preferred method for maintaining consistency across multiple pages. CSS also supports advanced
            features such as animations, transitions, and flexbox for efficient alignment and distribution of elements.
            With the evolution of CSS, modern techniques like CSS Grid and variables have made styling more flexible and
            powerful, reducing the reliance on complex frameworks.</u>
