<p class="pv">Font variant is a typographic property that allows for the customization of text appearance by modifying the style of characters without changing the font family. It is commonly used to enable small caps, ligatures, or numeric variations in different writing systems. By adjusting the font-variant property, text can appear more refined or stylistically appropriate for certain designs. This feature is particularly useful in web design and digital typography, where maintaining consistency and readability is essential. Different values such as normal, small-caps, and various numeric options provide flexibility in how text is presented.
